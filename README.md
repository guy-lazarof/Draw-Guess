# Draw-Guess
Hello! 
Welcome to my Draw & Guess app!

#### To play with a friend by real time ,enter the link! :)
### [➡️ Open the app ⬅️](https://draw-and-guess-nacx.onrender.com)

## If you want to work on code local do this -
### cd frontend -> npm i --force -> npm start
### cd backend -> npm i -> npm run dev

### Some info about the project:
- The frontend build by React
- The app is for 2 players, I used webSocket (socket.io lib)
- (It sometimes better to play by 2 differents browsers - or one of them by incognito)
- For the canvas I used - react-canvas-draw lib

## Have fun! :)
